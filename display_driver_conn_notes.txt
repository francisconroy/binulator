Can use the Adafruit schematic for reference

Use the lib https://github.com/adafruit/TFTLCD-Library


Resolution 
240x320

1.65 - 3.3V IO voltage (suggest using 3V3)
Use 3V3 for VDDI and VCI (ag)

LCD voltage drive
VCOM needs 4.5 - 5.5 V?
VCL needs -2.0V - -3.0V (suggest 2.5V)

Backlight? 

Resistive touch - Don't even wire this up

Different interface options 
- I suggest using 8bit parallel option with low colour resolution option

- Set IDLE mode ON, to allow for sleep(which we won't actually use) BUT this gives us reduced colour mode (8colour)
