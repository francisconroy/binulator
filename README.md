# BINULATOR
The binulator is intended to be a binary calculator intended for use by programmers, electrical/mechatronics engineers, and PLC technicians to assist with configuration and testing of communication systems and embedded projects which involve extensive binary operations, i.e. bitfields, masks and other calculations. 

This calculator intends to be better than a regular scientific calculator for this purpose by providing easy access to common binary functions and emulating some specific hardware behaviours (i.e. integer rollover, signed arithmetic) and allowing for setting of specific variable widths from 8bit to 64bit.

The first version of the calculator will most likely NOT perform floating point calculations and isn't a replacement for your scientific calculator.
